```c#
using QuestPDF.Fluent;
using QuestPDF.Helpers;
using QuestPDF.Infrastructure;

// code in your main method
Document.Create(container =>
{
    container.Page(page =>
    {
        page.Size(PageSizes.A4);
        page.Margin(2, Unit.Centimetre);
        page.Background(Colors.White);
        page.DefaultTextStyle(x => x.FontSize(20));
        
        page.Header()
            .Text("Hello PDF!")
            .SemiBold().FontSize(36).FontColor(Colors.Blue.Medium);
        
        page.Content()
            .PaddingVertical(1, Unit.Centimetre)
            .Column(x =>
            {
                x.Spacing(20);
                
                x.Item().Text(Placeholders.LoremIpsum());
                x.Item().Image(Placeholders.Image(200, 100));
            });
        
        page.Footer()
            .AlignCenter()
            .Text(x =>
            {
                x.Span("Page ");
                x.CurrentPageNumber();
            });

## Code-Focused Paradigm

### Modular and Maintainable C# Code

Implement modular PDF layouts with reusable well-organized classes and methods. 
Refactor safely with IntelliSense - your logic stays seamlessly integrated with your domain code.

### Familiar Programming Concepts

Use conditions, loops, LINQ, and extension methods to effortlessly generate dynamic, data-driven PDF documents tailored to your unique business needs.

### Git-Friendly Workflow

Enjoy straightforward C# code reviews, meaningful pull-request diffs, and cleaner version control histories.

```csharp
.Column(column =>
{
    if (Model.Comments != null)
        column.Item().Text(Model.Comments);

    foreach(var item in Model.Items)
       column.Item().Element(c => CreateItem(c, item);
});
```

```diff
void CreateItem(IContainer container, Item item)
{
    container
-       .Background(Colors.Grey.Lighten2)
+       .Background(item.Color)
        .Padding(10)
        .Text(item.Text);
}
```
